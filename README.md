# Summar(AI)ze

This is a web application built with React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Zustand, and TypeScript. The app utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4 model to summarize articles.

## Features

- **Article Summarization:** The app uses OpenAI's GPT-4 model to generate concise summaries of articles. Users can enter the URL or copy-paste the article text into the application, and the summarization process will be initiated.
- **Interactive User Interface:** The application provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with the summarization process seamlessly. The input form is intuitive, and the summarized output is presented in a clear and readable format.
- **React and Vite:** The app is built with React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and Vite, a fast development server and bundler. React ensures a smooth and responsive user experience, while Vite optimizes the development and build process.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Tailwind CSS is used for styling the application. It provides a utility-first approach, allowing for easy and efficient customization of the app's appearance. The app is designed to be visually appealing and responsive across different devices and screen sizes.
- **Zustand:** Zustand is a state management library for React applications. It is used in this app to manage the application's state, including the user input, the summarization process, and the resulting summary. Zustand simplifies state management and ensures a consistent and reliable application state.
- **TypeScript:** The entire application is written in TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript. TypeScript adds type checking, enabling better code quality and improved developer productivity. It enhances code readability and provides better tooling support.
